# The Future - My niece's first site

The kids are our future. I prepped a playground for my niece to help her create her first site. Maybe that's something all girls, 10 years of age, should have the opportunity to do in order to strengthen the equality in tech? ❤️

Steps with niece
1. Choose a fun theme!
2. Decide and insert title
3. Choose 3 backgroundcolors, insert
4. Discuss, choose and insert text for accessibility
5. Chose image, insert
6. Insert info-text
7. Celebrate!
